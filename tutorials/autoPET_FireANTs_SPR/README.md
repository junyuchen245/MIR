We show here that the idea of spatially varying regularization that was presented in our paper "[**Unsupervised Learning of Spatially Varying Regularization for Diffeomorphic Image Registration**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17982)" can also be extended to instance-optimization, or virtually any optimization-based registration methods.

The code for the FireANTs-SPR model is in `MIR/src/MIR/models/fireants/` (to be added...).
